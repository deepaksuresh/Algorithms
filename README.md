My implementation of the game asteroids in python

I created this game as a part of coursework in coursera's "Introduction to interactive Programming in Python". This was the final project.
You can play the game at [PlayAsteroids](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_KvzkRB4CFk_3.py), click on the play button to launch the game.
